# multisig_vault

TODO explain the exact steps to take to setup the local environment, the order in which you should deploy the local canisters, the commands to do so, and the canister ids you should have after each step

Deploy with original signers and threshold:

```bash
dfx deploy --argument='(vec { principal "qaxqg-4ymay-xutcp-nnull-fvtqf-5p6d4-mxbja-i6t5s-wz7kb-csadv-qqe" }, 1)'
```
